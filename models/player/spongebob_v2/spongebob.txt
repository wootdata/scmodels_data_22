Description             : Model of SpongeBob SquarePants Created for [USA]Rev for Half-Life

Additional Credits to   : [USA]Rev for paying for my copy of MilkShape that
			  let me create this model for him.
=============================================================================

This is a totally custom model for [USA]Rev, member of Team USA.

This model was created totally from scratch other than the skeleton
and animations that were converted and scaled from a variety of different
Half-Life models, (and quite and effort at that!).

The textures were gathered from many sources, but the best one came from
DocRock and BabyKitKat, thanks you two!

All model work was done in Milkshape 1.6.5.

All of the graphics work was done using Microsoft Imager2,
Wally, Photostyler, mgi Photosuite, and any other tool that
let me do what I needed.

I created the entire mesh in one marathon session, about 8 hours
total time.  The animations took another 4 or 6 hours and there were
several hours checking all the animations (LOL, you should have seen
what it looked like at Cucamonga Chunk O'Phlem with 8 or 10 Spongebobs
all fragging each other like mad!).

This model is a little over 1/2 scale (0.54 actually).  I tried to
make it larger but it just didn't look right IE: it got too wide,
so this is what it is and so be it.

This model has the following statistics:
Verticies: 610
Triangles: 1132
   Groups: 6
Materials: 4
   Joints: 22

All in all, not bad!
