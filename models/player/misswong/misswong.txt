=============================================================================

This is an HLDM version of an Action Half-Life player model, one of a set.

The original model was created by Ian Waugh ... please see the MissWong_orig.txt file

The only changes done were to implement the HLDM animation set.

All model work was done in Milkshape.

The total modification took about 1 hour from start to finish plus some time
checking the animations out to make sure they were done correctly.
